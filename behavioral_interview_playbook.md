## 14. Why TikTok (Shop)?

Yeah, sure — I’m really interested in joining TikTok, especially the TikTok Shop team.

TikTok is a product with hundreds of millions of users. The scale and impact are huge.

And TikTok Shop is one of the key parts of that ecosystem — it’s not just a side feature, it’s a major driver for growth.

Since it launched in the U.S. in 2023, it’s still pretty new. That means a lot of room to grow, a lot of challenges to solve. I really enjoy that kind of environment — fast-moving, full of problems to fix and things to improve.

I have around ten years of front-end experience, mostly building large-scale web apps. I love optimizing performance and improving user experience.

What gives me the most satisfaction is when millions of users can actually see and use what I build. I want them to feel that the product is fast, easy to use, and enjoyable.

For me, TikTok Shop feels like the perfect mix — huge impact, fast growth, and tons of opportunities to make a difference.
