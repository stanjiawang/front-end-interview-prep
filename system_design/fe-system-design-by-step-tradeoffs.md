## 🥇 Step 1: Requirements Clarification & Scoping

**🎯 Goal:** Define functional and non-functional requirements clearly, narrowing scope to manageable range.

| Category | Tech Stack / Tools | Trade-offs (Pros & Cons) | Key Discussion Points |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Performance Metrics** | Core Web Vitals (LCP / INP / CLS / TTFB / TBT) | ✅ Quantifiable & measurable<br>❌ Hard to optimize all at once | Which metric matters most to users? How do we monitor it? |
| **Platform Target** | Web / PWA / Mobile Web / Desktop (Electron/Tauri) | ✅ Multi-platform reach<br>❌ UX parity difficult | Should we go cross-platform or specialize per device? |
| **Internationalization (i18n/l10n)** | next-intl / react-intl / i18next | ✅ Scalable global reach<br>❌ Increases bundle & build complexity | Locale routing? Dynamic translation loading? |
| **Browser Compatibility** | Modern bundle / Polyfill / Babel targets | ✅ Broader user support<br>❌ Larger build, slower runtime | Do we need to support legacy browsers? |
| **SEO & Discoverability** | SSR / SSG / Sitemap / Meta tags | ✅ Better ranking, social previews<br>❌ Requires server rendering | Is SEO critical to business growth? |

## 🥈 Step 2: High-Level Architecture

**🎯 Goal:** Define rendering strategy, framework, and key architecture choices.

| Architecture Type | Best Use Cases | Advantages | Disadvantages | Trade-offs / Interview Highlights |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **CSR (SPA)** | Internal tools, dashboards, post-login apps | Simple setup, fully client-driven | Slow first paint, poor SEO | Use for apps where SEO is irrelevant |
| **SSR (Next.js/Remix)** | E-commerce, content-heavy pages | Fast LCP, SEO friendly | Server cost, caching complexity | Good balance of performance + SEO |
| **SSG/ISR** | Blogs, marketing pages | Extremely fast, CDN friendly | Limited dynamic content | Ideal for mostly static content |
| **Hybrid (Next.js App Router)** | Content + application mix | Combines SEO & interactivity | Complexity & learning curve | Modern default choice for large-scale apps |
| **Micro-Frontends** | Multi-team enterprise | Independent deploys, scalable | Shared deps & perf overhead | Autonomy vs runtime performance |

| Domain | Tech Stack | Trade-offs |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Framework** | React / Vue / Svelte / Solid | React = ecosystem, Svelte = speed |
| **Language** | TypeScript / JavaScript | TS adds safety, but increases onboarding |
| **Styling** | CSS Modules / Tailwind / Styled Components | Tailwind = speed, Modules = semantics |
| **Build Tools** | Vite / Webpack / Turbopack | Vite = DX, Webpack = plugins, Turbo = fastest |

---

## 🥉 Step 3: Data Model & API Interface

**🎯 Goal:** Define core data entities and client-server communication strategy.

| Area | Options | Trade-offs | Discussion Points |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **API Protocol** | REST / GraphQL / tRPC / WebSocket | REST = simple, GraphQL = flexible, tRPC = type-safe, WS = real-time but heavy | Based on data shape & team expertise |
| **Pagination** | Offset / Cursor | Offset simple, Cursor stable | Cursor for consistent infinite scroll |
| **Caching** | Cache-Control / ETag / SWR / React Query | Faster but invalidation complexity | stale-while-revalidate pattern |
| **API Design** | OpenAPI / Swagger / GraphQL schema | Self-doc + validation | How to version APIs? |
| **Modeling** | TypeScript Interfaces / Prisma Schema | Type safety across layers | Shared schema strategy |

---

## 🏅 Step 4: State Management & Data Flow

**🎯 Goal:** Manage app data, flow, and synchronization across components efficiently.

| Layer | Tech Options | Trade-offs | Interview Talking Points |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Global State** | Redux Toolkit / Zustand / Recoil | Redux = strict + debuggable, Zustand = simple + light | “When to use Redux vs Zustand?” |
| **Server State** | React Query / SWR / Apollo Client | Great caching + retry; learning curve | Explain `staleTime`, `invalidate`, optimistic updates |
| **Local UI State** | Hooks / Context API | Native, simple, but re-render risk | Avoid overusing Context |
| **Data Sync** | Background refetch / Optimistic update / Dedup | Smooth UX but adds complexity | Conflict handling strategies |
| **Offline Support** | PWA + IndexedDB / LocalStorage | Works offline, sync issues | Using React Query persist plugin |

---

## 🧠 Step 5: Deep Optimization & Details

**🎯 Goal:** Optimize for performance, maintainability, security, and accessibility.

| Area | Techniques | Trade-offs | Key Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Performance** | Code Splitting / Lazy Loading / Preload / Suspense | Lower bundle but adds async complexity | Page-level vs component-level splitting |
| **Image Optimization** | Next/Image / WebP / responsive srcset | Greatly reduces LCP | SSR integration overhead |
| **Rendering Efficiency** | Virtualized list / Web Worker / requestIdleCallback | Better INP, less blocking | Complexity, scroll sync issues |
| **Security** | CSP / Trusted Types / HttpOnly Cookie / CSRF Token | Strong protection, adds config load | XSS/CSRF best practices |
| **Design System** | MUI / Radix UI / shadcn/ui / Storybook | Consistency, accessibility | Initial setup time | 
| **Accessibility (a11y)** | aria-* / eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y / axe | Legal compliance, inclusivity | Requires audits |

## 🧾 Step 6: Summary & Trade-offs

**🎯 Goal:** Justify design choices clearly with pros and cons.

| Domain | Common Choices | Trade-offs | Interview Takeaway |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Rendering Mode** | CSR / SSR / SSG | SSR = SEO but cost; CSR = simplicity | Pick per page type (hybrid) |
| **State Management** | React Query / Redux / Zustand | Query = remote; Redux = workflow | Layer separation shows maturity |
| **Styling** | Tailwind / CSS Modules | Speed vs semantics | Tailwind for speed, CSS Modules for clarity |
| **Auth Strategy** | Session / JWT | Session = security; JWT = scalability | Mention HttpOnly Cookie |
| **Architecture** | Monolith / Micro-Frontend | Centralized vs autonomous | Organization drives architecture |

---

**💬 Interview Tip:**  
> For each step, aim to show awareness of *why* you made a choice — not just *what* you chose.  
> Use language like “I optimized for performance and developer velocity, which led me to choose SSR + React Query + Zustand combination.”
