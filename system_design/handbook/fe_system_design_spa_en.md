## Front-End System Design: Component Architecture and Large-Scale SPA Design

### Problem Description

**Example Question:**
> "Suppose you need to design the front-end architecture for a large single-page application (SPA) similar to TikTok. How would you divide component modules, manage application state, and ensure the scalability of the entire SPA architecture?"

This question assesses your ability to architect a large-scale SPA — covering component breakdown, state management, routing design, performance, and scalability considerations.

### Interviewer’s Intent

The interviewer wants to evaluate the candidate’s understanding of front-end system design, including:

1. Mastery of **component-based architecture** and **layered design**, and ability to decompose complex UIs into reusable components.
2. Familiarity with **SPA architecture patterns**, including routing, state management, and modular development.
3. **Architectural thinking** — ability to design for scalability, team collaboration, and performance (e.g., code-splitting, lazy loading).
4. Practical **experience designing front-end architectures** in large projects, and capacity to reason about trade-offs between different approaches.

### Structured Answer Framework

#### 1. Overall Architecture Design
- Choose a suitable front-end framework (React, Vue, or Angular) with a component-driven approach.
- Justify the choice — for example, React’s mature ecosystem, efficient virtual DOM, and composability.
- For large SPAs, recommend **React + TypeScript + Vite** or **Next.js** (for SSR/SSG support).
- Consider **Monorepo** architecture (Nx, Turborepo) for managing separate app modules (user, video, comments, notifications, etc.).

#### 2. Component Structure and Design
- Decompose the UI into a clear, hierarchical component tree:
  - **Top-Level Components:** Navigation bar, layout shell, sidebar.
  - **Module Components:** Video feed, comments section, user profile panel.
  - **UI Components:** Buttons, avatars, cards, modals, etc.
- Follow the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and **Separation of Concerns**.
- Example: TikTok Web
  - `<VideoFeed />` — video stream component
  - `<CommentPanel />` — comment section
  - `<UserSidebar />` — user information + recommendations

### 3. State Management Strategy

- Differentiate **global state** vs **local state**:
  - Global: Auth user, player status, theme → Redux, Recoil, Zustand, or Context API.
  - Local: UI states (e.g., modal open/close) → `useState` or `useReducer`.
- Follow the rule: *“Keep state local unless shared.”*

```ts
interface RootState {
  user: UserState;
  videoFeed: VideoFeedState;
  player: PlayerState;
  ui: UIState;
}
```

- Handle async logic with middleware:
  - Redux Toolkit + Thunk/Saga for API data fetching.
  - Encapsulate API layer with Axios instance (with interceptors for auth and errors).

---

### 4. Routing and Code-Splitting

- Use **React Router** or **Vue Router** for client-side routing.
- Apply **Lazy Loading** and **Code Splitting**:

```tsx
const Profile = React.lazy(() => import('@/pages/Profile'));

<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
</Suspense>
```

- Split routes into independent bundles to minimize initial load.
- Example for TikTok-like app:
  - Home feed, Following feed, Profile page → separate bundles.
  - Load core shell first, defer others until needed.
- Optionally use **Preload strategies** to anticipate next route load.

### 5. Performance and Scalability

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Rendering:** Virtual DOM, diffing, `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`.
- **Lists:** Virtualized scrolling (react-window / react-virtualized).
- **Initial Load:** SSR or static pre-rendering (Next.js) for SEO and faster TTFB.
- **Assets:** Gzip/Brotli compression, WebP images, CDN caching.
- **Bundling:** Dynamic imports to reduce main bundle size.

#### Scalability Strategies
- **Plugin-based architecture:** Allow new features via module registration.
- **Design System:** Shared UI library (Storybook + Figma) for visual consistency.
- **Monorepo management:** Nx/Turborepo for modular build pipelines.
- **Type safety:** End-to-end TypeScript adoption for maintainability.

### 6. Real-World Example — TikTok Web

**Architecture Overview:**
- **Global State:** Current video ID, player controls, auth.
- **Inter-Component Communication:** Through global store (Redux/Context).
- **Lazy Loading:** Load only visible modules; defer others.
- **Optimizations:**
  - Virtualized video list.
  - Preload next video in feed.
  - Encapsulate `<VideoPlayer />` core logic for reuse.

### 7. Technical Details and Implementation Examples

#### React Component Hierarchy
```
<App>
  ├── <Header />
  ├── <Sidebar />
  ├── <MainContent>
  │     ├── <VideoFeed />
  │     │     ├── <VideoCard />
  │     │     ├── <LikeButton />
  │     │     └── <CommentSection />
  │     └── <UserProfile />
  └── <Footer />
```

#### Redux Store Example
```ts
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    user: userReducer,
    feed: feedReducer,
    player: playerReducer,
  }
});
```

#### Lazy Loading Example
```tsx
const VideoDetailPage = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/VideoDetail'));
```

### 8. Best Practices and Considerations

1. **Separation of Concerns**  
   - UI components → Presentation only.  
   - Container components → Data and logic.

2. **Global State Discipline**  
   - Avoid over-centralization.  
   - Use derived/memoized states instead of redundant ones.

3. **Built-in Performance Strategy**  
   - Virtualized lists, memoization, lazy loading.

4. **Team Collaboration**  
   - Enforce lint/prettier rules.  
   - Use commitlint/changelog automation.

5. **Continuous Improvement**  
   - Track metrics (LCP, FCP, TTFB) with analytics tools.
   - Monitor via Sentry, Datadog, or NewRelic.

### Summary

By applying these architectural principles, you can:

- Design a maintainable and scalable SPA architecture.
- Achieve a balance between performance, modularity, and development velocity.
- Support rapid iteration in a multi-team environment.
- Demonstrate senior-level system design thinking and practical engineering depth.
