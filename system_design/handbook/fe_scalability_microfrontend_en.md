## Scalability and Maintainability: Micro-Frontend Architecture and Module Boundaries

### Problem Description

**Example Question:**
> “As the team and business grow, front-end projects often become massive. What architectural designs would you adopt to ensure scalability and maintainability? Please discuss using micro-frontend architecture and modular boundary design.”

This question evaluates the candidate’s ability to design scalable front-end architectures for large, multi-team projects — emphasizing **micro-frontend architecture** and **module boundary design**.

### Interviewer’s Intent

The interviewer wants to know whether the candidate:

1. Understands the concept and value of **micro-frontend architecture** — including independence, incremental upgrades, and multi-team collaboration.
2. Has **modular thinking** — can define clean module boundaries with clear contracts to reduce coupling.
3. Knows how to ensure **maintainability** — through code organization, dependency management, versioning, and CI/CD practices.
4. Considers **scalability** — how the system handles growth, feature expansion, and parallel development.

### Structured Answer Framework

#### 1. Modularization and Boundary Design

**1.1 Modular Division Principles**
- Divide based on business domains or core functionalities (domain-driven design).
- For example, TikTok Web could include:
  - **Feed module** (video stream)
  - **Chat module** (messaging)
  - **Profile module** (user info)
  - **Settings module** (preferences)
- Each module can be a separate folder, npm package, or subproject.

**1.2 Design Rules for Module Boundaries**
- **High cohesion, low coupling:** Encapsulate logic within modules and expose only public APIs.
- **Stable Contracts:** Use TypeScript types or API schemas to enforce clear module interfaces.
- **No cross-boundary imports:** Communication via services, events, or shared interfaces only.
- **Abstract shared layers:** Extract reusable components (UI Kit), utilities, and state management into shared libraries maintained by the platform team.

**1.3 Team Mapping and Collaboration**
- Align module boundaries with team boundaries.
- Each team owns a module, minimizing code conflicts.
- Shared infrastructure (frameworks, lint rules, CI templates) managed centrally.

#### 2. Micro-Frontend Architecture

**2.1 Definition**
> A micro-frontend architecture splits a front-end application into multiple independently developed, tested, and deployed micro-applications combined at runtime into a seamless user experience.

**2.2 When to Use Micro-Frontends**
- The monolithic app becomes too large to build or test efficiently.
- Multiple teams need to develop and deploy features concurrently.
- Gradual migration from legacy systems is required.

**2.3 Key Benefits**
- **Team autonomy:** Each team can develop and deploy independently.
- **Tech stack freedom:** Teams can use React, Vue, or other frameworks.
- **Incremental migration:** Replace legacy modules gradually.
- **Reduced risk:** Deployments are isolated.

**2.4 Integration Patterns**

| Integration Mode | Description | Pros | Cons |
|------------------|-------------|------|------|
| **Build-time Integration (Monorepo)** | All submodules built into a single app | Simple, shared dependencies | Not truly independent; redeploy required |
| **Iframe Integration** | Sub-apps embedded via iframes | Strong isolation | Poor routing and communication |
| **Runtime JS Integration (Single-SPA / Qiankun / Module Federation)** | Load sub-app bundles dynamically | Flexible and scalable | Requires dependency and routing coordination |
| **Web Components Integration** | Sub-apps as custom HTML elements | Framework-agnostic | Implementation complexity and browser support |

#### 3. Micro-Frontend Implementation Details

**3.1 Common Frameworks and Tools**
- **Single-SPA:** Defines lifecycle hooks (bootstrap, mount, unmount).
- **Qiankun:** Built on Single-SPA; provides sandboxing and style isolation.
- **Webpack Module Federation:** Enables dynamic module loading and dependency sharing across applications.

**3.2 Qiankun Example**
```js
// Main app registers sub-apps
registerMicroApps([
  {
    name: 'video-app',
    entry: 'https://cdn.tiktok.com/video-app/',
    container: '#micro-container',
    activeRule: '/video',
  },
  {
    name: 'chat-app',
    entry: 'https://cdn.tiktok.com/chat-app/',
    container: '#micro-container',
    activeRule: '/chat',
  },
]);

start();
```
Sub-app lifecycle hooks:
```js
export async function bootstrap() {}
export async function mount(props) {
  renderApp(props.container);
}
export async function unmount() {
  destroyApp();
}
```

**3.3 Style and Dependency Isolation**
- **CSS Isolation:** Use CSS Modules, BEM, or Qiankun’s sandboxing.
- **Shared Dependencies:** Configure shared modules with Webpack Module Federation.
  ```js
  shared: { react: { singleton: true, requiredVersion: '^18.0.0' } }
  ```
- Prevents redundant React/Vue copies while maintaining isolation.

**3.4 Routing and Communication**
- **Centralized routing:** The main app manages routes; sub-apps register prefixes (e.g., `/feed`, `/chat`).
- **Communication patterns:**
  - Global event bus (`window.eventBus.emit('login')`)
  - CustomEvent / DOM events
  - Shared store via encapsulated APIs (avoid global state sharing)

**3.5 CI/CD and Deployment**
- Each sub-app builds and deploys independently.
- The main shell dynamically loads the latest versions via configuration or manifest.
- Supports **blue-green** or **canary releases**.

**3.6 Monitoring and Governance**
- Use unified monitoring (Sentry, Datadog, internal APM).
- Include module identifiers in logs and metrics.
- Centralized analytics SDK for consistent telemetry.

#### 4. Maintainability and Engineering Governance

**4.1 Repository Strategy**

| Mode | Description | Pros | Cons |
|-------|-------------|------|------|
| **Monorepo** | Manage multiple packages via Lerna/Nx | Centralized management, shared deps | Large repo, slow builds |
| **Multi-repo** | Each module has its own repo | Full autonomy, fast CI | Version management complexity |

**4.2 Component Library and Design System**
- Develop a shared UI library using Storybook or internal tooling.
- Maintain consistent look & feel and accessibility.

**4.3 Code Standards and Testing**
- Enforce **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and TypeScript.
- Automated testing: **Jest** (unit), **Cypress/Playwright** (E2E).
- **Contract testing** ensures module interface compatibility.

**4.4 Documentation and Knowledge Base**
- Maintain a central wiki or architecture site.
- Each module documents responsibilities, dependencies, interfaces, and CI/CD steps.

**4.5 Continuous Refactoring and Evolution**
- Periodic architecture reviews to refine module boundaries.
- Abstract complex or cross-cutting logic into shared packages.
- Encourage evolutionary architecture and modular culture.

#### 5. Performance and Complexity Management

**5.1 Performance Considerations**
- Initial load faster (only current micro-app loads).
- Optimize shared dependencies to avoid redundant downloads.
- Use **lazy loading** and **prefetching** for better UX.

**5.2 Isolation Practices**
- Each sub-app uses a unique namespace for CSS, localStorage, and global variables.
  ```
  localStorage.setItem('videoApp:token', token);
  ```

**5.3 Governance and Oversight**
- Standardize dependency versions.
- Establish a **Front-End Architecture Council** for consistency in authentication, error handling, and analytics.
- Platform team maintains shared tooling (CLI, CI templates, monitoring).

---

#### 6. Best Practices and Cautions

1. **Evaluate Use Case:** Micro-frontends are ideal for large-scale, multi-team systems — not small projects.
2. **Maintain Unified UX:** The shell manages global layout, navigation, and theme.
3. **Clear Boundaries:** No cross-app dependencies; all shared logic belongs in a platform layer.
4. **Monitor Continuously:** Measure performance and dependency health.
5. **Promote Modular Culture:** Encourage engineers to think in modular, contract-based design.

---

### Summary

A scalable and maintainable front-end architecture should be:

- **Well-structured:** Clear module ownership and isolation.
- **Highly cohesive, loosely coupled:** Modules evolve independently.
- **Team-autonomous:** Independent development and deployment.
- **Centrally governed:** Unified dependencies, design system, and observability.

> Micro-frontends are not a silver bullet but a powerful strategy for large-scale governance. When designed correctly, they enable TikTok-scale teams to develop and deploy concurrently — achieving both rapid iteration and long-term maintainability.
