## üîë Key Takeaways

-   **Choose Vite if:** You want *speed*, *modern features*, and
    *minimal config* out of the box. Perfect for React, Vue, Svelte, or
    any modern frontend project.
-   **Choose Webpack if:** You need deep customization, enterprise-level
    complex build pipelines, or have legacy support requirements.
-   **Choose CRA if:** You want a beginner-friendly, zero-config React
    starter --- though Vite is now often recommended instead because of
    better speed and flexibility.

## üöÄ Summary

Vite is considered the **next generation front-end tooling** because
it: - Starts the dev server almost instantly, even for large projects. -
Compiles only what's needed on demand. - Delivers faster HMR, improving
developer productivity. - Produces optimized production bundles with
Rollup.

For most new projects, **Vite is now the preferred choice** over CRA or
raw Webpack.
